    "To generate human faces using GANs, you can use a pre-trained model or create your own GAN model from scratch. However, training a GAN to generate high-quality human faces requires significant computational resources. A more practical approach would be to use an already trained model like StyleGAN2 or BigGAN, which are popular choices for generating realistic human faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, I'll walk you through using **StyleGAN2** with a pre-trained model to generate human faces. You can use the **torch** and **torchvision** libraries in Python to interact with the model. Here's a Python script that demonstrates how to generate human faces using a pre-trained **StyleGAN2** model."

    "4. **Processing and displaying the image:** After generating the face, the script processes the tensor output into an image that can be displayed using PIL."
